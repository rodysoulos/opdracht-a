# Assignment: Validating HTML

*PLEASE READ THIS **ENTIRE** DOCUMENT FIRST*

## The assignment

Download this repo and run this project locally. Validate the local HTML with the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) (you can use the **Validate by Direct Input** option to copy and paste your HTML into this area). Fix all issues in the index.html. 

Tip: do this step by step and re-validate the code again; sometimes multiple errors disappear when fixing 1 line.
The only purpose of this assignment is to have no warnings or errors, so do some research (google) if you can't fix things immediately. 

Make sure that this edited website has no errors or warnings anymore.
